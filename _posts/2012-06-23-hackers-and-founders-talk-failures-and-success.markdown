title: "Hackers & Founders Talk - Failures (and Success) + Slides"
---

A few days ago I had the chance to give a talk to the local Wellington Hackers & Founders meetup about some of the successes and failures I’ve had with 3 of my startups. Slides are embedded below for convenience.

As well, here is a list of the books I referenced in my talk:

__“The Founders Dilemma”__ - Noam Wasserman

__“4 Steps to the Epiphany”__ - Steve Blank

__“The Startup Owner’s Manual”__ - Steve Blank

__“The Lean Startup”__ - Eric Ries

A huge thanks for the H&F group for having me. They are currently taking donations for the group if you’re interested in supporting them.
