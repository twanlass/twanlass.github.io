## The Vibes Are Strong
If there's one thing you'll notice as you continue down the web3 rabbit hole – it's the vibes.

There's something unique about the projects, teams, and communities you encounter in the web3 space.

They just feel different.

Sometimes it's the funky visuals or retro design. Sometimes it's the language or tone. And other times it's the user experience that's just unlike many of the apps we use to today.

Another possible reason: I've heard it said that web3 is the first native version of the internet. That is, these new experiences are not just digital takes of offline concepts (i.e. eBay was a digital take on an offline auction). Instead, web3 experiences are a digital takes on digital concepts.

And yes, the marquee tag (that thing that scrolls text horizontally across your screen) is making a hell of comeback.

## Counterculture
Web3 feels like a new counterculture experience. Here's what you might notice as you dive in:

### Positivity and Optimism​
There's a strong sense that anything is possible and that the best days are still ahead.

If you haven't already, you'll soon come across acronyms that encapsulate this feeling nicely:

- **gm** – or good morning ☀️
- and **wagmi** – or we are gonna make it

With gm it's a simple hello and recognition of others in the community that are working towards building something new. There's an acknowledgement that regardless of others' time of day (we may not be in the same place or time), we say good morning to each other and assume best intent.

Similarly with wagmi, it's a way expressing a positive outlook on the future. Together, we're gonna make it. This is also often used in contrast (and in good fun) with ngmi – not gonna make it. 😆
​
### ​Inclusivity
​There's a push to bring diverse perspectives (beyond that of the white male ✋🏻) into this next era of the web. To include, and be informed by, subcultures other than just tech – like music, fashion, and fine art.

Information is shared freely, teams are building in public, and many individuals are paying it forward by helping to onboard those just behind them in their own learning journey.
​​
​In many ways, the web3 community is deliberately planting the seeds for the next era of the internet – a different kind of internet.
​
Which leads us to...
​
### ​Public goods
​Web3 culture talks a lot about decentralization.

Decentralization is one way to create a set of experiences, protocols, and communities that benefit the wider public first and foremost – public goods.

Much like the roads, bridges, and other infrastructure of our physical world, decentralization can help with the creation of public goods on the internet.

In contrast, web2 is highly centralized and owned by a handful of large tech companies. It's an internet in which much of the value is created by you and I – yet a majority of the rewards are enjoyed by the minority (large tech companies).

### Here's your takeaway:
​Web3 culture is an acknowledgment that an internet built by us all should benefit us all.
