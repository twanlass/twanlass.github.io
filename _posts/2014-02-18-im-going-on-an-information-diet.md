title: 'I'm Going on an (Information) Diet'
---

It's been 14 days since I've disconnected from the larger grid. 

No news. No aimless web surfing. No status updates or Insta-anythingsâ„¢. Even harder for me though, no Hacker News and no Dribbble (and no links to those sites in case you're trying to avoid them too).

Another thing of the past? *Constant* 24-7 email checking. No more reading email in bed before I go to sleep. Or worse, reading in bed for 20 minutes after just waking up. 

I now check my email (all 4 accounts) twice a day and that's it. I find 12pm & 4pm to work just fine. What a tall order considering I use email to run a few of my businesses. 

**But guess what?** 

So far, not a single missed opportunity. No angry customers or clients. No world-ending emergencies.

Instead I'm now more productive and focused than ever. I'm spending more time with my loved ones and more time doing the things I care about. 

My wife is even giving it a go too. What's worse than competing against a smart phone for your partner's attention? A lot of things, but you get the point.

##Want to try this yourself?

1. **Remove all your time-wasting apps.** Get rid of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, NPR, Podcasts, etc from your phone and other devices.
2. **Stop the automatic email flood.** Instead of 100 vibrating interruptions throughout the day, set your mobile email to [manually fetch email](http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-to-turn-off-push-email-on-your-iphone-5) only when you want it. You're battery life will improve too - bonus!
3. **Check & respond to email only 1-2 times a day.** Don't leave your email app or tabs open either. When you're checking and responding to email do that and only that. 
4. **Limit TV watching and other leisure activities.** Work on a side project or hobby instead. 
5. **Use a simple daily task list.** Now that you've freed up a bunch of time don't waste it. Use a simple task list to get *1-2 high priority* tasks done each day. I've been using a [bullet journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) for a few months and love it. 
6. **Disconnect.** Nothing improves your state of mind and helps you do better work than stepping away from everything for a bit. Go outside and try new things.

The last thing I want to highlight though is that this isn't about ultra efficiency and cramming more productive work hours into the day. For me it's quite the opposite. I want to work less and spend more quality time doing the things I love. Removing a lot of the above has helped me to do just that by freeing up several hours per day.

'Editors' footnote - since starting my diet Facebook has sent me 12 (TWELVE!!) emails about missed status updates, group invites and messages. Wow.
