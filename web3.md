**Alright, let’s jump in:**

​This newsletter is all about web3 – _for normal humans_.

Yes, this includes things like Bitcoin.

But Web3, more broadly, is about so much more. And I think it's way more interesting than just digital money.

Each issue I’m going to focus on just one topic to start. I'll break each topic down in plain English – including no (unexplained) acronyms and no word salad. 🙅‍♂️ 🥗

And I’ll keep each issue intentionally short – because who has time for a 15,000 word essay right now? This one is only 677 words...

### Here’s what we’ll be learning about together:
Or: what the heck is web3?

- **Internet native money** – imagine if credit cards and payments had been baked into web browsers from the very start. We’ll chat cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance or DeFi – and yes, even Bitcoin. For now though, you can think of this as a new foundational Lego™ block for the future of the internet and commerce.

- **Public databases** – you've probably heard of the blockchain. But what is it? It turns out we can build some pretty cool things if more of the worlds data is open, public, and trust-less. We'll learn about the blockchain and things like peer-to-peer file sharing too.

- **Building in public** – is it radical to share your business strategy, product roadmap, or revenue, publicly? We’ll dive into decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs, treasuries (how these organizations manage money), and governance (how they decide what to build, where to go).

- **New types of incentives** – to tackle some of the worlds biggest and most interesting problems we’ll need more humans to work together, better. Enter coins or tokens, and concepts like cryptoeconomics for alignment of humans at scale.

- **Real ownership of digital property** – Imagine if Picasso could have earned a commission every time a piece of his artwork was resold at auction or to a private collector.¡Muy interesante! We’ll chat about non-fungible tokens or NFTs, and why owning digital property matters.

- **Internet-wide login / identity** – lastly, isn’t it strange that we have a different login and profile for every website or app we use ("no mom, you can’t use the same password on every website")? Cue wallets, the Ethereum Name Service or ENS, and on-chain (the blockchain that is) street cred.
And that's some of the stuff we'll learn about together. Hopefully there's an idea or concept in there that's got your brain whirring.

​
**​TL;DR** – I think we need many more smart humans – like you! – to put their brainpower on these concepts. So that we can have more discussions, more ideas, and more diversity. 🧠

Many people I chat with about this space think it's mostly about finance. That crypto = day trading or speculating on bitcoins and digital art.

I think that's one of the least interesting parts of this story.

I believe web3 can enable massive new forms of innovation and creativity for the world. And while doing so, radically redistribute wealth.

Wealth of time (increased freedom), social (more/better relationships), physical (better health), and yes, even financial wealth.

But what’s holding back more smart minds from diving in to contribute and help shape this new frontier?

I believe in part it's the endless acronyms; massive information overload; an inaccessible cool kids culture; and honestly, just some real world examples about how these concepts can be applied to things we understand today and the challenges we're facing right now.

So there you have it.

That’s why I’m writing this. To get more people – like you! – involved. 😉
