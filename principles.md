These are a set of foundational principles and mental models I'm finding repeatedly useful in my life.

This list is just for me, though I encourage you to think about and document your own. I may or may not write more about each specific one. Last updated **July 1st, 2021**.

* You can learn from anyone
* The only constant is change
* Be wary of absolutes
* Default to trust
* Relationships over transactions
* Necessary, but not sufficient
* See the trees, see the forest
* Alchemy is real
