title: "Features vs Benefits"
---

You may have heard this before in marketing circles. Don't speak at your customers. Speak to them. Don't rattle off a list a features. Share with them the benefits. 

More is less. 

Simple Goods - we've built less 'features' - instead focused on the benefits. 

Doing a few things really well. 

Give each benefit / feature a few iterations. 

Handful of polished interactions / features better than  laundry list

You can charge more for benefits than you can for the shear # of features

We want to be Whole Foods not Costco
