I update my now page a few times a year to share a little bit about my current state. It's largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). Last updated **December 14th, 2021**.

I'm writing a private newsletter on web3. You can read the [first issue](https://ckarchive.com/b/p9ueh9hp409k) online.

I'm renovating a [hundred year old house](https://www.instagram.com/cherrystreetrenovation/).

I live in the Pacific Northwest with my wife, two daughters, and a dog.

I'm currently exploring: web3, purchasing micro SaaS businesses, <s>short-term rental real estate, real estate development</s>.

I'm currently the VP of Design at [Buffer](https://buffer.com).
