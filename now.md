title: Now

I update my now page a few times a year to share a little bit about my current state. It's largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). Last updated **May 9th, 2021**.

I'm renovating a [hundred year old house](https://www.instagram.com/cherrystreetrenovation/).

I'm taking an extended break from social media.

I live in the Pacific Northwest with my wife, two daughters, and a dog.

I'm currently researching / exploring purchasing early stage SaaS businesses (<10K MRR; 50+ paying customers), short-term rental real estate, and real estate development.

I'm currently the VP of Design at [Buffer](https://buffer.com).
